        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Form-associated custom elements allow custom elements to participate in forms to the same degree as native elements, including integrations with the form’s validation, state, and submission as well as exposing the Accessibility Object Model to the element.</p>
        <p>A sample use case can be found in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-custom-form-controls-with-elementinternals/">this article by Caleb Williams</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>One of the most common use cases for web components is creating form controls not available natively. Some examples include switches and credit card inputs.</p>
        <p>There is no way for forms to fully integrate with form elements located in a different shadow root the same way they would with form elements in the same root. The only options available to achieve a similar result are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The formdata event: this event only provides integration on form submission. Using this feature alone may also lead to accessibility issues due to the lack of cross-root ARIA.</li>
          <li>
            Setting a form element in light DOM (e.g. using slots): this gives web components authors two main options both of which will only work with standard form elements, mostly for form submission, and require both implementers and end users to write more code:
            <ul>
              <li>Visually hide the form element in light DOM and synchronize its value to a visible form element located inside the web component’s shadow root.</li>
              <li>Have both the form element and its label located in slots and forgo the granular control shadow DOM gives you over how to allow for CSS customization.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This situation has forced developers to either not use web components for form elements or create their own form systems that allow for full integration (e.g. many big web component libraries such as Lion or Shoelace provide form systems that integrate with their components). This limits the reach web components could have as plug-in form elements for projects created with different tech stacks.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Shadow root encapsulation currently prevents references between elements in different roots. Croot-root ARIA references would re-enable this platform feature within shadow roots.</li>
          <li>It's not possible to "forward" ARIA attributes from a custom element host into elements in the host's shadow root. For instance, a custom input that wants to allow users to customize the ARIA role, has no way to forward the role attribute to the encapsulated native input.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>It's critically important that content on the web be accessible. Making web component content accessible currently requires many complicated and only partially-successful work-arounds, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Observing and moving ARIA-related attributes across elements (for role, etc.)</li>
          <li>Using non-standard attributes for ARIA features, in order to apply them to elements in a shadow root.</li>
          <li>Requiring that custom elements users wrap/slot elements so that ARIA attributes can be placed directly on them. This gets very complicated as the number of slotted inputs and levels of shadow root nesting increase.</li>
          <li>Duplicating nodes across shadow root boundaries</li>
          <li>Abandoning Shadow DOM</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Constructable Stylesheets and `adoptedStyleSheets` enable adding styles directly to shadow roots without creating new DOM elements. Because a single stylesheet object can be adopted by multiple scopes, it also allows sharing of styles that can be centrally modified.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no effective way to share styles across components while allowing them to be centrally modified.</li>
          <li>Creating `&lt;style&gt;` elements for each style used in each shadow root has a measurable performance overhead.</li>
          <li>CSS Module Scripts, another critical feature, depends on constructible stylesheets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>CSS Module Scripts allow JavaScript modules to import style sheets. They can then be applied to a document or shadow root using adoptedStyleSheets in the same way as constructible style sheets.</p>
        <pre class="javascript">
          import styleSheet from "./styles.css" assert { type: "css" };
          document.adoptedStyleSheets = [ styleSheet ];
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS modules will allow styles to be loaded in component definitions without adding `&lt;style&gt;` or `&lt;link&gt;` elements that need to be created in each element instance.</li>
          <li>Authors today often use inlined CSS strings in JS modules, but many of them want to move the CSS into separate .css files.</li>
          <li>Without CSS-in-JS it's difficult to ensure that CSS is loaded before the component is defined and rendered. CSS module scripts provide the same ordering guarantee.</li>
          <li>Component authors may need to import a resource that is only available as an external .css file, and don't have control over the resource to wrap it in a JS module.</li>
        </ul>
